# Big Data Management Project: Bankruptcy Prediction

Train and Test sets have been created using caret function createDataPartition with random seed=123 (see Quarto file)
The goal is to have roughly the same proportion of positive cases (bankrupt companies) in both the train and test sets


Train Set: 5456 samples (~80%) with 181 bankrupt companies (~3.3%)
Test Set: 1363 samples (~20%) with 39 bankrupt companies (~2.9%)
